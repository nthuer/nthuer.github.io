            My name is Niklas and i currently study business informatics at the Fontys Hogeschool in Venlo. Beside only studying I got a student job in the IT-Sec sector.
            Before my time as a student i went through an apprenticeship in Aachen at the GRÃœN Software AG and finished as a certified software developer. The schoolpart of this apprenticeship was absolved at the BWV also in Aachen.
            I am born at the 14th of October 1995, so you can calculate my age on your own ;-)

                Well yes. Another big topic during my apprenticeship. I did a lot of web development with mainly using PHP for the business logics.
                This included also a lot use of SQL. (Yes it was secured against SQL injection:P). But I also used it in private projects which sadly have been lost on a lost harddrive.

                Java is one of my longest partners in programming. I started learning it at high school during computer science classes but it's usage continued during my apprenticeship and my follow up study.
                I still have to admin that I am not a big fan of it. It works but it still does not have a special place at my IT heart.

                On my job in the IT-Sec sector i build a sharepoint wiki. This system was also providing services with the usage of Nintex Forms/Workflow.
                These services were created to allow a unified usage of request for the whole company.
